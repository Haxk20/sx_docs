If you have previously flashed *any* version of a Sony-Open-Devices-based ROM
from before **December 17th 2018**, your `dsp` partition might have wrong
SELinux labels and you might thus have problems with audio.

## Short version
Either re-flash the `dsp` partition with stock firmware via Sony's own
[Emma][emma] or the open-source [FlashTool][flashtool], or manually force
the correct file labels. You need to be root via `adb shell` or in recovery:
```
su
# It might be either /system/vendor/dsp or /vendor/dsp depending on your device
# Just try both until one succeeds
mount -o remount,rw /system/vendor/dsp
chcon -R u:object_r:adsprpcd_file:s0 /dsp
```
Reboot, et voil√† - you should have proper audio again.

If you only want to fix your audio problem, you can stop reading now.

## Long version
Sony devices have a `dsp` partition that holds firmware files and libraries
needed for the [Qualcomm "Hexagon" DSP][hexagon] - *Digital Signal Processor*.

The partition is shippped with the [SELinux file label][source-selinux-label]
`u:object_r:adsprpcd_file:s0` by default, and stock firmware uses this label
as well when flashed via `Emma` or `FlashTool`.

When stellirin rewrote the SODP sepolicy in late 2017, they
[chose to use `qdsp_file`][rewrite-qdsp] instead of `adsprpcd_file` for `/dsp`.
A few lines of code [were added in `init.$device.rc`][tone-init] - which gets
run under the label `vendor_init` to re-mount the dsp partition and update it to
use the `qdsp_file` label.

Because re-labeling these files as `vendor_init` is a
[neverallow in Pie][relabel-neverallow], we noticed that we should rather be
re-using the stock file labels, i.e. `adsprpcd_file`.  
The relabeling bit(`restorecon_recursive`) [was removed][init-drop-dsp]
from its new location in `init.common.rc` and the "new" old label
[was restored][sepolicy-adsp].

As stated in the "short version", fixing the problem is easy: Run `chcon` or run
`Emma` - Emma [can now flash single partitions][emma-single], which is great.

## Conclusion
A small inconsistency can cause a whole lot of trouble. Who could have predicted
back in 2017 that Google would tighten the security around re-labeling files?  
The transition is going to be a bit painful, but in the end, re-using
`adsprpcd_file` is the better solution.
